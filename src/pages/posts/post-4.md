# Overview

In our last run-in with GraphQL, we used Prisma to assist in setting up a GraphQL server. This effectively gave us an endpoint to work with for making GraphQL requests against the database we specified when getting started. If you're still in the business of setting up a GraphQL server, there are plenty of alternative services to Prisma you could explore. Apollo is perhaps the most popular. A different approach could be to use GraphCMS: a headless CMS for building GraphQL models with a beautiful interface.

With our first models are created and deployed, we’re now able to explore GraphQL hands-on. Prisma (and just about any other service) gives us the luxury of a “playground” interface, where we can write all sorts of nonsensical and otherwise dangerous shit. This is our opportunity to get comfortable before unleashing our ignorance upon the world in a production environment. To guide us, I’ll be using my own example of creating models, importing dummy data, and how to write the queries to fetch said data
